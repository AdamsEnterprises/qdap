Our instruments to melancholy bells, Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast, Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change, Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse, And all things change them to the contrary.} \code{All this I know; and to the marriage Her nurse is privy.} \code{All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?} \code{all this uttered With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd, Could not take truce with the unruly spleen Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast, Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point, And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats Cold death aside, and with the other sends It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity, Retorts it.} \code{Alla stoccata carries it away.} \code{although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night.} \code{Am I like such a fellow?} \code{Amen!} \code{Amen, amen!} \code{An a speak any thing against me, I'll take him down, an a were lustier than he is, and twenty such Jacks;

Therefore, have done.} \code{An old hare hoar, And an old hare hoar, Is very good meat in lent But a hare that is hoar Is too much for a score, When it hoars ere it be spent.} \code{an thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords.} \code{An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend; And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets, For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee, Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.} \code{An you re us and fa us, you note us.} \code{Ancient damnation!} \code{And art thou changed?} \code{and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself.} \code{And bad'st me bury love.} \code{And but one word with one of us?} \code{and by the operation of the second cup draws it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.} \code{and down again!} \code{and farewell, good fellow.} \code{and foot it, girls.} \code{And for that offence Immediately we do exile him hence.} \code{And from my soul too; Or else beshrew them both.} \code{and having now provided A gentleman of noble parentage, Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd, Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts, Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man; And then to have a wretched puling fool, A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender, To answer I'll not wed; I cannot love, I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.} \code{and he and I Will watch thy waking, and that very night Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.} \code{And here he writes that he did buy a poison Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.} \code{and how doth she?} \code{And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget, Forgetting any other home but this.} \code{And I for winking at your discords too Have lost a brace of kinsmen.} \code{And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.} \code{And in his needy shop a tortoise hung, An alligator stuff'd, and other skins Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves A beggarly account of empty boxes, Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds, Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses, Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.} \code{And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death Thou shalt continue two and forty hours, And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.} \code{And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers brains, and then they dream of love; O'er courtiers knees, that dream on court'sies straight, O'er lawyers fingers, who straight dream on fees, O'er ladies lips, who straight on kisses dream, Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.} \code{and in your clothes!} \code{and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?} \code{And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?} \code{And joy comes well in such a needy time.} \code{And madly play with my forefather's joints?} \code{and Mercutio slain!} \code{And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?} \code{And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?} \code{And she's fair I love.} \code{And since that time it is eleven years; For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood, She could have run and waddled all about; For even the day before, she broke her brow.} \code{And so did I.} \code{And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.} \code{And stay thy lady too that lives in thee, By doing damned hate upon thyself?} \code{And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.} \code{And steep'd in blood?} \code{And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.} \code{and strength shall help afford.} \code{and tell my lady I am gone, Having displeased my father, to Laurence cell, To make confession and to be absolved.} \code{And then my husband--God be with his soul!} \code{And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.} \code{And this shall free thee from this present shame; If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear, Abate thy valour in the acting it.} \code{And thou must stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?} \code{and tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.} \code{And too soon marr'd are those so early made.} \code{And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.} \code{And we mean well in going to this mask; But tis no wit to go.} \code{And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?} \code{and what says My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?} \code{And what to?} \code{and when thou hast done so, Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!} \code{And why, my lady wisdom?} \code{And yet I wish but for the thing I have.} \code{And yet I would it were to give again.} \code{And yet no further than a wanton's bird; Who lets it hop a little from her hand, Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, And with a silk thread plucks it back again, So loving-jealous of his liberty.} \code{and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling!} \code{And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone; A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly.} \code{and yet, methinks, it should not, For he hath still been tried a holy man.} \code{And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.} \code{and, by my holidame, The pretty wretch left crying and said Ay.} \code{and, if aught in this Miscarried by my fault, let my old life Be sacrificed, some hour before his time, Unto the rigour of severest law.} \code{And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.} \code{And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone, As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?} \code{and, lips, O you The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss A dateless bargain to engrossing death!} \code{And, Montague, come you this afternoon, To know our further pleasure in this case, To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.} \code{and, swifter than his tongue, His agile arm beats down their fatal points, And twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled; But by and by comes back to Romeo, Who had but newly entertain'd revenge, And to t they go like lightning, for, ere I Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.} \code{And, to sink in it, should you burden love; Too great oppression for a tender thing.} \code{Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb; And by and by my master drew on him; And then I ran away to call the watch.} \code{Anon!} \code{Anon, anon!} \code{Anon, good nurse!} \code{Answer me like men.} \code{answer to that; Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.} \code{Antony, and Potpan!} \code{Any man that can write may answer a letter.} \code{apothecary!} \code{Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh.} \code{Are you at leisure, holy father, now; Or shall I come to you at evening mass?} \code{Are you so hot?} \code{are you up?} \code{Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she.} \code{Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.} \code{Arms, take your last embrace!} \code{Art thou a man?} \code{Art thou gone so?} \code{Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?} \code{Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness, And fear'st to die?} \code{As I did sleep under this yew-tree here, I dreamt my master and another fought, And that my master slew him.} \code{as I discern, It burneth in the Capel's monument.} \code{As I remember, this should be the house.} \code{As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun, Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand Murder'd her kinsman.} \code{As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine; And all combined, save what thou must combine By holy marriage.} \code{As much to him, else is his thanks too much.} \code{As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie; Poor sacrifices of our enmity!} \code{as sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast!} \code{As that is desperate which we would prevent.} \code{ask for me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man.} \code{At my poor house look to behold this night Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.} \code{At the hour of nine.} \code{At this same ancient feast of Capulet's Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest, With all the admired beauties of Verona.} \code{At thy good heart's oppression.} \code{At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?} \code{Away to heaven, respective lenity, And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!} \code{Away with the joint-stools, remove the court-cupboard, look to the plate.} \code{Away, begone; the sport is at the best.} \code{Ay me!} \code{Ay, a thousand times.} \code{Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, tis enough.} \code{Ay, ay, the cords.} \code{Ay, boy, ready.} \code{Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.} \code{Ay, forsooth.} \code{Ay, if I know the letters and the language.} \code{Ay, let the county take you in your bed; He'll fright you up, i faith.} \code{Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.} \code{Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.} \code{Ay, nurse; what of that?} \code{Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.} \code{Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.} \code{Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.} \code{Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense thou wilt.} \code{Ay, those attires are best.} \code{Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o the collar.} \code{Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time; But I will watch you from such watching now.} \code{Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring; Your tributary drops belong to woe, Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.} \code{Be fickle, fortune; For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long, But send him back.} \code{be merciful, say death; For exile hath more terror in his look, Much more than death.} \code{Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.} \code{Be not so long to speak; I long to die, If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.} \code{Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.} \code{Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.} \code{Be quiet, or--More light, more light!} \code{Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.} \code{Bear hence this body and attend our will.} \code{beat them down!} \code{Beautiful tyrant!} \code{Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!} \code{Being held a foe, he may not have access To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear; And she as much in love, her means much less To meet her new-beloved any where.} \code{Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.} \code{Being in night, all this is but a dream, Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.} \code{Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.} \code{Benedicite!} \code{Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?} \code{Beshrew my very heart, I think you are happy in this second match, For it excels your first.} \code{Beshrew your heart for sending me about, To catch my death with jaunting up and down!} \code{Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.} \code{Bid her devise Some means to come to shrift this afternoon; And there she shall at Friar Laurence cell Be shrived and married.} \code{Black and portentous must this humour prove, Unless good counsel may the cause remove.} \code{Blind is his love and best befits the dark.} \code{Bliss be upon you!} \code{Blister'd be thy tongue For such a wish!} \code{Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud; Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies, And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine, With repetition of my Romeo's name.} \code{Both by myself and many other friends.} \code{both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies.} \code{both with an R.} \code{Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.} \code{Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.} \code{Bring forth the parties of suspicion.} \code{brother, ho!} \code{Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.} \code{but all this did I know before.} \code{but come what sorrow can, It cannot countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight.} \code{But come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; For this alliance may so happy prove, To turn your households rancour to pure love.} \code{but farewell compliment!} \code{but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say.} \code{But he which bore my letter, Friar John, Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight Return'd my letter back.} \code{But he, his own affections counsellor, Is to himself--I will not say how true-- But to himself so secret and so close, So far from sounding and discovery, As is the bud bit with an envious worm, Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air, Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.} \code{But He, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail!} \code{But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.} \code{But I can give thee more.} \code{But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry In what I further shall intend to do, By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.} \code{But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd Your lady's love against some other maid That I will show you shining at this feast, And she shall scant show well that now shows best.} \code{But let them measure us by what they will; We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.} \code{But look thou stay not till the watch be set, For then thou canst not pass to Mantua; Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends, Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back With twenty hundred thousand times more joy Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.} \code{But Montague is bound as well as I, In penalty alike; and tis not hard, I think, For men so old as we to keep the peace.} \code{But new struck nine.} \code{But no more deep will I endart mine eye Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.} \code{But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.} \code{But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?} \code{But old folks, many feign as they were dead; Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.} \code{But one, poor one, one poor and loving child, But one thing to rejoice and solace in, And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!} \code{But passion lends them power, time means, to meet Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.} \code{But sadly tell me who.} \code{But saying o'er what I have said before.} \code{But that a joy past joy calls out on me, It were a grief, so brief to part with thee.} \code{But then a noise did scare me from the tomb; And she, too desperate, would not go with me, But, as it seems, did violence on herself.} \code{but this intrusion shall Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.} \code{But thou art not quickly moved to strike.} \code{But to be frank, and give it thee again.} \code{But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true Than those that have more cunning to be strange.} \code{But what say you to Thursday?} \code{But when I came, some minute ere the time Of her awaking, here untimely lay The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.} \code{but where hast thou been, then?} \code{But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death, Romeo is banished, to speak that word, Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, All slain, all dead.} \code{But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart, My will to her consent is but a part; An she agree, within her scope of choice Lies my consent and fair according voice.} \code{but, as I said, On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen; That shall she, marry; I remember it well.} \code{But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you.} \code{but, gentle nurse, I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night, For I have need of many orisons To move the heavens to smile upon my state, Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.} \code{but, I pray, can you read any thing you see?} \code{But, soft!} \code{But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?} \code{buy food, and get thyself in flesh.} \code{By'r lady, thirty years.} \code{By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am.} \code{By and by!} \code{By and by, I come.} \code{By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
