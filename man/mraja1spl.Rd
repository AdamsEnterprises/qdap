But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the furthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Aurora's bed, Away from the light steals home my heavy son, And private in his chamber pens himself, Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out And makes himself an artificial night.} \code{Ah ha, my mistresses!} \code{Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late.} \code{Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.} \code{Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!} \code{Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!} \code{Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!} \code{An honour!} \code{An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.} \code{and foot it, girls.} \code{And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers brains, and then they dream of love;

Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers eyes; Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers tears.} \code{Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun Peer'd forth the golden window of the east, A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad; Where, underneath the grove of sycamore That westward rooteth from the city's side, So early walking did I see your son.} \code{Madam, I am here.} \code{Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in the pantry, and every thing in extremity.} \code{Madam, your mother craves a word with you.} \code{Many a morning hath he there been seen, With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.} \code{Marry, bachelor, Her mother is the lady of the house, And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;

women grow by men.} \code{Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.} \code{Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone; We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.} \code{Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.} \code{Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet; For you and I are past our dancing days.} \code{Nay, that's not so.} \code{No better.} \code{No less!} \code{No, coz, I rather weep.} \code{No, for then we should be colliers.} \code{No, marry; I fear thee!} \code{No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I bite my thumb, sir.} \code{no, sir.} \code{No.} \code{Not having that, which, having, makes them short.} \code{Not I, believe me.} \code{Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;

she hath Dian's wit; And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd, From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.} \code{She's not fourteen.} \code{She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow Do I live dead that live to tell it now.} \code{She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste, For beauty starved with her severity Cuts beauty off from all posterity.} \code{She is the fairies midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep; Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders legs, The cover of the wings of grasshoppers, The traces of the smallest spider's web, The collars of the moonshine's watery beams, Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film, Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, Not so big as a round little worm Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub, Time out o mind the fairies coachmakers.} \code{She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair, To merit bliss by making me despair.} \code{she that makes dainty, She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?} \code{She will not stay the siege of loving terms, Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.} \code{Show me a mistress that is passing fair, What doth her beauty serve, but as a note Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?} \code{Signior Martino and his wife and daughters; County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece Rosaline;

and then anon Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again.} \code{Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose, And then dreams he of smelling out a suit; And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail Tickling a parson's nose as a lies asleep, Then dreams, he of another benefice.} \code{Speak briefly, can you like of Paris love?} \code{Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?} \code{Stay, fellow; I can read.} \code{Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!} \code{strike!} \code{Strike, drum.} \code{Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When well-apparell'd April on the heel Of limping winter treads, even such delight Among fresh female buds shall you this night Inherit at my house;

He that is strucken blind cannot forget The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.} \code{They must take it in sense that feel it.} \code{This is that very Mab That plats the manes of horses in the night, And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs, Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes.} \code{This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage.} \code{This is the matter.} \code{This love feel I, that feel no love in this.} \code{this love that thou hast shown Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.} \code{This night I hold an old accustom'd feast, Whereto I have invited many a guest, Such as I love; and you, among the store, One more, most welcome, makes my number more.} \code{This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; Examine every married lineament, And see how one another lends content And what obscured in this fair volume lies Find written in the margent of his eyes.} \code{This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover.} \code{This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what.} \code{This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.} \code{This, by his voice, should be a Montague.} \code{thou canst not teach me to forget.} \code{Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.} \code{Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.} \code{Thou talk'st of nothing.} \code{Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.} \code{Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.} \code{Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age; Wilt thou not, Jule?} \code{Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit; Wilt thou not, Jule?} \code{Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word, By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets, And made Verona's ancient citizens Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments, To wield old partisans, in hands as old, Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate.} \code{Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.} \code{Thus then in brief.} \code{tis gone, tis gone, tis gone.} \code{tis not so much, tis not so much.} \code{Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;

I am not here; This is not Romeo, he's some other where.} \code{Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning, One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish; Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning; One desperate grief cures with another's languish.} \code{Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by, Herself poised with herself in either eye.} \code{twas no need, I trow, To bid me trudge.} \code{Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe, A villain that is hither come in spite, To scorn at our solemnity this night.} \code{Under love's heavy burden do I sink.} \code{Up.} \code{Verona's summer hath not such a flower.} \code{Was that my father that went hence so fast?} \code{We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf, Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath, Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;

And these, who often drown'd could never die, Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!} \code{Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?} \code{Where's this girl?} \code{Where shall we dine?} \code{wherefore storm you so?} \code{which of you all Will now deny to dance?} \code{Which on more view, of many mine being one May stand in number, though in reckoning none, Come, go with me.} \code{While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, Came more and more and fought on part and part, Till the prince came, who parted either part.} \code{whither should they come?} \code{Whither?} \code{who calls?} \code{Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?} \code{Whose house?} \code{why call you for a sword?} \code{Why, how now, kinsman!} \code{Why, may one ask?} \code{why, no.} \code{Why, Romeo, art thou mad?} \code{Why, such is love's transgression.} \code{why, then, I thank you all I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.} \code{Why, then, O brawling love!} \code{Why, uncle, tis a shame.} \code{Will you tell me that?} \code{Wilt thou not, Jule?} \code{Ye say honestly.} \code{Yea, quoth he, dost thou fall upon thy face?} \code{Yea, quoth my husband fall'st upon thy face?} \code{Yes, better, sir.} \code{Yes, madam.} \code{yet I cannot choose but laugh, To think it should leave crying and say Ay.} \code{Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.} \code{you'll be the man!} \code{You'll make a mutiny among my guests!} \code{You'll not endure him!} \code{You are a lover;
