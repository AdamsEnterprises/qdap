qdap 0.2.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `word_associate` colors the word cloud appropriately and deals with the error 
  caused by a grouping variable not containing any words from 1 or more of the 
  vectors of a list supplied to match string

* `trans.cloud` produced an error when expand.target was TRUE.  This error ha 
  been eliminated.

* `termco` would eliminate > 1 columns matching an identical search.term found 
  in a second vector of match.list.  termco now counts repeated terms multiple 
  times.

NEW FEATURES

* `bivar_gradcloud`: Bi-variate gradient Word Cloud - A new plotting function 
  that plots and colors words for a bi-variate variable based on which group of 
  the bi-variate variable uses the term more frequently.

MINOR FEATURES

* `stemmer`, `stem2df` and `stem.words` now explicitally have the argument 
  char.keep set to "~~" to enable retaining special character formerly stripped 
  away.
