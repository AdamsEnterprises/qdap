qdap 0.2.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `word_associate` colors the word cloud appropriately and deals with the error 
  caused by a grouping variable not containing any words from 1 or more of the 
  vectors of a list supplied to match string

* `trans.cloud` produced an error when expand.target was TRUE.  This error ha 
  been eliminated.

* `termco` would eliminate > 1 columns matching an identical search.term found 
  in a second vector of match.list.  termco now counts repeated terms multiple 
  times.

* `folder` would not generate a directory with the time/date stamp if no 
  directory name was given.

NEW FEATURES

* `bivar_gradcloud`: Binary gradient Word Cloud - A new plotting function 
  that plots and colors words for a binary variable based on which group of 
  the binary variable uses the term more frequently.

* `new_project`: A project template generating function designed to increase 
  efficiency and standardize work flow.

MINOR FEATURES

* `stemmer`, `stem2df` and `stem.words` now explicitally have the argument 
  char.keep set to "~~" to enable retaining special character formerly stripped 
  away.

* `hms2sec`: A function to convert from h:m:s format to seconds.

* `mcsv_w` now takes a list of data.frames.

CHANGES

* `sec2hms` is the new name for `convert`
