    <h2>Arguments</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>text.var</dt>
      <dd>The text variable.</dd>
      <dt>grouping.var</dt>
      <dd>The grouping variables.  Default NULL
  generates one output for all text.  Also takes a single
  grouping variable or a list of 1 or more grouping
  variables.</dd>
      <dt>match.string</dt>
      <dd>A list of vectors or vector of terms
  to associate in the text.</dd>
      <dt>text.unit</dt>
      <dd>The text unit (either <code>"sentence"</code>
  or <code>"tot"</code>. This argument determines what unit to
  find the match string words within. For example if
  <code>"sentence"</code> is chosen the function pulls all text
  for sentences the match string terms are found in.</dd>
      <dt>extra.terms</dt>
      <dd>Other terms to color beyond the match
  string.</dd>
      <dt>target.exclude</dt>
      <dd>A vector of words to exclude from
  the <code>match.string</code>.</dd>
      <dt>stopwords</dt>
      <dd>Words to exclude from the analysis.</dd>
      <dt>network.plot</dt>
      <dd>logical.  If TRUE plots a network
  plot of the words.</dd>
      <dt>wordcloud</dt>
      <dd>logical.  If TRUE plots a wordcloud plot
  of the words.</dd>
      <dt>cloud.colors</dt>
      <dd>A vector of colors equal to the
  length of <code>match.string</code> +1.</dd>
      <dt>title.color</dt>
      <dd>A character vector of length one
  corresponding to the color of the title.</dd>
      <dt>nw.label.cex</dt>
      <dd>The magnification to be used for
  network plot labels relative to the current setting of
  cex.  Default is .8.</dd>
      <dt>title.padj</dt>
      <dd>Adjustment for the title. For strings
  parallel to the axes, padj = 0 means right or top
  alignment, and padj = 1 means left or bottom alignment.</dd>
      <dt>nw.label.colors</dt>
      <dd>A vector of colors equal to the
  length of <code>match.string</code> +1.</dd>
      <dt>nw.layout</dt>
      <dd>layout types supported by igraph.  See
  <code><a href='http://www.inside-r.org/r-doc/igraph/layout'>layout</a></code>.</dd>
      <dt>nw.edge.color</dt>
      <dd>A character vector of length one
  corresponding to the color of the plot edges.</dd>
      <dt>nw.label.proportional</dt>
      <dd>logical.  If TRUE scales the
  network plots across grouping.var to allow plot to plot
  comparisons.</dd>
      <dt>nw.title.padj</dt>
      <dd>Adjustment for the network plot
  title. For strings parallel to the axes, padj = 0 means
  right or top alignment, and padj = 1 means left or bottom
  alignment.</dd>
      <dt>nw.title.location</dt>
      <dd>On which side of the network
  plot (1=bottom, 2=left, 3=top, 4=right).</dd>
      <dt>title.font</dt>
      <dd>The font family of the cloud title.</dd>
      <dt>title.cex</dt>
      <dd>Character expansion factor for the
  title. NULL and NA are equivalent to 1.0.</dd>
      <dt>nw.edge.curved</dt>
      <dd>logical.  If TRUE edges will be
  curved rather than straight paths.</dd>
      <dt>cloud.legend</dt>
      <dd>A character vector of names
  corresponding to the number of vectors in
  <code>match.string</code>.  Both <code>nw.legend</code> and
  <code>cloud.legend</code> can be set separately; or one may be
  set and by default the other will assume those legend
  labels.  If the user does not desire this behavior use
  the <code>legend.override</code> argument.</dd>
      <dt>cloud.legend.cex</dt>
      <dd>Character expansion factor for
  the wordcloud legend. NULL and NA are equivalent to 1.0.</dd>
      <dt>cloud.legend.location</dt>
      <dd>The x and y co-ordinates to
  be used to position the wordcloud legend.  The location
  may also be specified by setting x to a single keyword
  from the list <code>"bottomright"</code>, <code>"bottom"</code>,
  <code>"bottomleft"</code>, <code>"left"</code>, <code>"topleft"</code>,
  <code>"top"</code>, <code>"topright"</code>, <code>"right"</code> and
  <code>"center"</code>. This places the legend on the inside of
  the plot frame at the given location.</dd>
      <dt>nw.legend</dt>
      <dd>A character vector of names
  corresponding to the number of vectors in
  <code>match.string</code>.  Both <code>nw.legend</code> and
  <code>cloud.legend</code> can be set separately; or one may be
  set and by default the other will assume those legend
  labels.  If the user does not desire this behavior use
  the <code>legend.override</code> argument.</dd>
      <dt>nw.legend.cex</dt>
      <dd>Character expansion factor for the
  network plot legend. NULL and NA are equivalent to 1.0.</dd>
      <dt>nw.legend.location</dt>
      <dd>The x and y co-ordinates to be
  used to position the network plot legend.  The location
  may also be specified by setting x to a single keyword
  from the list <code>"bottomright"</code>, <code>"bottom"</code>,
  <code>"bottomleft"</code>, <code>"left"</code>, <code>"topleft"</code>,
  <code>"top"</code>, <code>"topright"</code>, <code>"right"</code> and
  <code>"center"</code>. This places the legend on the inside of
  the plot frame at the given location.</dd>
      <dt>legend.override</dt>
      <dd>By default if legend labels are
  supplied to either <code>cloud.legend</code> or
  <code>nw.legend</code> may be set and if the other remains NULL
  it will assume the supplied vector to the previous legend
  argument.  If this behavior is not desired
  <code>legend.override</code> should be set to TRUE.</dd>
      <dt>char2space</dt>
      <dd>Currently a road to nowhere.
  Eventually this will allow the retention of characters as
  is allowed in <code>trans.cloud</code> already.</dd>

26   51         Prince   51 Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,-- Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts, That quench the fire of your pernicious rage With purple fountains issuing from your veins, On pain of torture, from those bloody hands Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground, And hear the sentence of your moved prince. Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word, By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets, And made Verona's ancient citizens Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments, To wield old partisans, in hands as old, Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate. If ever you disturb our streets again, Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace. For this time, all the rest depart away. You Capulet; shall go along with me. And, Montague, come you this afternoon, To know our further pleasure in this case, To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.

Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
28   53       Benvolio   53 Here were the servants of your adversary, And yours, close fighting ere I did approach. I drew to part them. in the instant came The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared, Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears, He swung about his head and cut the winds, Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn. While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, Came more and more and fought on part and part, Till the prince came, who parted either part.

30   55       Benvolio   55 Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun Peer'd forth the golden window of the east, A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad; Where, underneath the grove of sycamore That westward rooteth from the city's side, So early walking did I see your son. Towards him I made, but he was ware of me And stole into the covert of the wood. I, measuring his affections by my own, That most are busied when they're most alone, Pursued my humour not pursuing his, And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
31   56       Montague   56 Many a morning hath he there been seen, With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew. Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs; But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the furthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Aurora's bed, Away from the light steals home my heavy son, And private in his chamber pens himself, Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out And makes himself an artificial night. Black and portentous must this humour prove, Unless good counsel may the cause remove.

34   60       Montague   60 Both by myself and many other friends. But he, his own affections counsellor, Is to himself--I will not say how true-- But to himself so secret and so close, So far from sounding and discovery, As is the bud bit with an envious worm, Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air, Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.

44   74          Romeo   74 Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! serious vanity! Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health! Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!

46   78          Romeo   78 Why, such is love's transgression. Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast, Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest With more of thine. this love that thou hast shown Doth add more grief to too much of mine own. Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs; Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers eyes; Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers tears. What is it else? a madness most discreet, A choking gall and a preserving sweet.

54   88          Romeo   88 Well, in that hit you miss. she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit; And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd, From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd. She will not stay the siege of loving terms, Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold. O, she is rich in beauty, only poor, That when she dies with beauty dies her store.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
55   90          Romeo   90 She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste, For beauty starved with her severity Cuts beauty off from all posterity. She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair, To merit bliss by making me despair. She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow Do I live dead that live to tell it now.

Take thou some new infection to thy eye, And the rank poison of the old will die.

91  135          Nurse  135 Even or odd, of all days in the year, Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen. Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!-- Were of an age. well, Susan is with God; She was too good for me. but, as I said, On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen; That shall she, marry; I remember it well. Tis since the earthquake now eleven years; And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,-- Of all the days of the year, upon that day. For I had then laid wormwood to my dug, Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall; My lord and you were then at Mantua.-- Nay, I do bear a brain.--but, as I said, When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool, To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug! Shake quoth the dove-house. twas no need, I trow, To bid me trudge. And since that time it is eleven years; For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood, She could have run and waddled all about; For even the day before, she broke her brow. And then my husband--God be with his soul! A was a merry man--took up the child. Yea, quoth he, dost thou fall upon thy face? Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit; Wilt thou not, Jule? and, by my holidame, The pretty wretch left crying and said Ay. To see, now, how a jest shall come about! I warrant, an I should live a thousand years, I never should forget it. Wilt thou not, Jule? quoth he; And, pretty fool, it stinted and said Ay.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
92  137          Nurse  137 Yes, madam. yet I cannot choose but laugh, To think it should leave crying and say Ay. And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone; A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly. Yea, quoth my husband fall'st upon thy face? Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age; Wilt thou not, Jule? it stinted and said Ay.'

120 176       Mercutio  176 O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep; Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders legs, The cover of the wings of grasshoppers, The traces of the smallest spider's web, The collars of the moonshine's watery beams, Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film, Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, Not so big as a round little worm Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub, Time out o mind the fairies coachmakers. And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers brains, and then they dream of love; O'er courtiers knees, that dream on court'sies straight, O'er lawyers fingers, who straight dream on fees, O'er ladies lips, who straight on kisses dream, Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are. Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose, And then dreams he of smelling out a suit; And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail Tickling a parson's nose as a lies asleep, Then dreams, he of another benefice. Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades, Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is that very Mab That plats the manes of horses in the night, And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs, Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage. This is she--

122 178       Mercutio  178 True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes Even now the frozen bosom of the north, And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.

124 180          Romeo  180 I fear, too early. for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed in my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death.

132 195          Romeo  195 O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright! It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear; Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear! So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows, As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows. The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand, And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand. Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!

14                                                                                                                                                                                                       At my poor house look to behold this night Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.
15                                       Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When well-apparell'd April on the heel Of limping winter treads, even such delight Among fresh female buds shall you this night Inherit at my house; hear all, all see, And like her most whose merit most shall be.
16                                                                                                                                                                                        Which on more view, of many mine being one May stand in number, though in reckoning none, Come, go with me.

32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                --Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret.
33                                                                                                                                                                                                                           --nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
40                                                                                                                                                                                                              Even or odd, of all days in the year, Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
45                                                                                                                                                             Tis since the earthquake now eleven years; And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,-- Of all the days of the year, upon that day.
46                                                                                                                                                                         For I had then laid wormwood to my dug, Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall; My lord and you were then at Mantua.
47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         -- Nay, I do bear a brain.
51                                                                                                                   And since that time it is eleven years; For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood, She could have run and waddled all about; For even the day before, she broke her brow.
56                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    and, by my holidame, The pretty wretch left crying and said Ay.
60                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                quoth he; And, pretty fool, it stinted and said Ay.
63                                                                                                                                                                                                                         yet I cannot choose but laugh, To think it should leave crying and say Ay.
64                                                                                                                                                                        And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone; A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly.
67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            it stinted and said Ay.
68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
74                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Tell me, daughter Juliet, How stands your disposition to be married?
77                                                                                                                                                                                                                   were not I thine only nurse, I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
78                                                                                                                                                                                         Well, think of marriage now; younger than you, Here in Verona, ladies of esteem, Are made already mothers.
79                                                                                                                                                                                                                      by my count, I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid.
80                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Thus then in brief.
81                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

86                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      What say you?
87                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        can you love the gentleman?
88  This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; Examine every married lineament, And see how one another lends content And what obscured in this fair volume lies Find written in the margent of his eyes.

86                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      What say you?
88  This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; Examine every married lineament, And see how one another lends content And what obscured in this fair volume lies Find written in the margent of his eyes.

117                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        What, man!
122                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Why, how now, kinsman!
123                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           wherefore storm you so?
128                                                                                                                                                                 It is my will, the which if thou respect, Show a fair presence and put off these frowns, And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
130                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                What, goodman boy!
141                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what.
149                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         What, cheerly, my hearts!
150                                                                                                                  Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers kiss.
159                                                                                                                                                                                                                             why, then, I thank you all I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
