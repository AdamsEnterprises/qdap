## Frequently Asked Questions

This FAQ is compiled from the [issues](https://github.com/trinker/qdap/issues) and messages I received from blog posts and emails, etc.

1. **qdap** does not work...
  - Please first update all your R packages (use `update.packages()`) and probably R itself ([what is the current R version?](http://cran.r-project.org/)), then see if it works; if not, next [check your version of Java](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61803503/packages/qdap_vignette.html#java).  If this still does not fix the problem please file an [issue](https://github.com/trinker/qdap/issues) report.
1. What is the best place to ask questions when the [package website](http://trinker.github.io/qdap/) or [vignette](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61803503/packages/qdap_vignette.html) is not helpful?
  - Depending what you want to ask, you may use these tools (I keep track of the first three more frequently):
  - (Recommended) [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/qdap): general questions (more experts and quicker answers there).
  - [Github issues](https://github.com/trinker/qdap/issues): bug reports and feature requests.
  - Private <a href="mailto:tyler.rinker@gmail.com" target="_blank">tyler.rinker@gmail.com</a> is the least recommended way unless this is really private issue.
